# Java Multithreading

Simple notes from my Java lecture on **Threads, Static Variables, Race Conditions, and Thread Synchronization**.

## Basic Thread
# Task 2 - 2 oct

### Main.java
```
class Student {
    static int count = 0;

    Student() {
        count++;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s1 = new Student();
        Student s2 = new Student();
        Student s3 = new Student();

        System.out.println(Student.count);
    }
}
```

### ThreadMain.java
-----------

```
public class ThreadMain {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        CookingTask task1 = new CookingTask("Cooking");
        CookingTask task2 = new CookingTask("Washing");
        CookingTask task3 = new CookingTask("Cleaning");

        task1.start();
        task2.start();
        task3.start();

        System.out.println("All tasks started...");
    }
}

class CookingTask extends Thread {

    private String taskName;

    public CookingTask(String taskName) {
        this.taskName = taskName;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {

        long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

        while (true) {

            System.out.println(
                    Thread.currentThread().getName()
                    + " - Running: " + taskName
            );


            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println(taskName + " interrupted.");
                break;
            }
            if (System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime >= 10_000) {
                break;
            }
        }

        System.out.println(taskName + " finished.");
    }
}

```

### Static vs Non-Static

```java
static int count;  // One shared copy for the class
int count;         // One copy for each object
```

### `start()` vs `run()`

```java
task.start();  // Starts a new thread
task.run();    // Normal method call

**Synchronized:**

```java
static synchronized void incrementCount() {
    staticCount++;
}
```
